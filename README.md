# Note-Book
An app used to write and save notes.

## Description

This app provides a quick and easy way to keep track of to-do's and general notes of importance. It allows you to add and delete notes. It saves the notes to a data base, so they remain, even if you exit the app and come back. It's a handy tool for remembering appts. and task. While building this project I was able to implement a Express.js back end that saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

Visit the app via url.

As notes accumulate, they are saved in the left hand column, if you click on a note in the left column it will preview to the right. Clicking the "+" button will clear the preview and allow for new entry. Using the trash icon in the left panel will delete the note.
